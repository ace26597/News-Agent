# Smart Date Extraction - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Enhanced the pharma news research agent to intelligently handle articles without publication dates using AI-powered content analysis.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Articles without explicit publication dates were discarded, losing potentially valuable recent content.

**After:** A fast LLM analyzes complete article context (URL, content, metadata) to extract dates. Articles are kept if extracted date is within search range.

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files

**`constants.py`**
- ✅ Added `DATE_EXTRACTION_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"` for fast, cheap date extraction

**`constants.py.example`**
- ✅ Added `DATE_EXTRACTION_MODEL` with documentation

**`config.py`**
- ✅ Added `DATE_EXTRACTION_MODEL` configuration support

### 2. Core Logic - `multi_agent_pharma.py`

**Enhanced `extract_date()` method:**
- ✅ Now extracts URL and metadata from article
- ✅ Passes complete context to LLM
- ✅ Builds metadata string with source and authors

**Enhanced `_llm_extract_date()` method:**
- ✅ Accepts URL and metadata parameters
- ✅ Uses `DATE_EXTRACTION_MODEL` (gpt-3.5-turbo) instead of main model
- ✅ Analyzes up to 3000 chars of content (was 1500)
- ✅ Includes URL (200 chars), title (500 chars), metadata (500 chars)
- ✅ Enhanced prompt to check URL first for dates
- ✅ Added success logging when date extracted

**Enhanced `_regex_extract_date()` method:**
- ✅ Now accepts URL parameter
- ✅ Added URL-specific regex patterns:
  - `/YYYY/MM/DD/` format
  - `/YYYYMMDD/` format (e.g., `/20240315/`)
- ✅ Increased search text to 2000 chars
- ✅ Updated parsing logic to handle URL date formats

**Enhanced date filtering workflow:**
- ✅ Added `llm_rescued` statistic tracking
- ✅ Logs articles rescued by LLM extraction
- ✅ Better debug logging for discarded articles
- ✅ Console output shows LLM rescued count

### 3. Documentation

**`README.md`**
- ✅ Added Smart Date Extraction to features list
- ✅ Added configuration section explaining two-tier LLM strategy
- ✅ Documented benefits and how it works

**`DATE_EXTRACTION_ENHANCEMENT.md`** (New)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation of enhancement
- ✅ Usage examples and scenarios
- ✅ Cost optimization details
- ✅ Testing instructions

**`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** (This file)
- ✅ Summary of all changes

## 🚀 How It Works

### Three-Stage Date Extraction

**Stage 1: Metadata Parsing**
```
Check if article has publication date → Parse it → Done ✅
```

**Stage 2: LLM Extraction (NEW & ENHANCED)**
```
No metadata date → Send to gpt-3.5-turbo with:
  - URL (check for /2024/03/15/ patterns)
  - Title (500 chars)
  - Content (3000 chars)
  - Metadata (source, authors)
→ Extract date → Validate → Done ✅
```

**Stage 3: Regex Fallback**
```
LLM failed → Apply regex patterns:
  - URL patterns: /YYYY/MM/DD/, /YYYYMMDD/
  - Content patterns: "Published on", dates, etc.
→ Extract date → Done ✅
```

### Filtering Logic
```
Article with date → Check if in range → Keep ✅
Article without date → Already processed by LLM → Discard ❌
Article with LLM-extracted date in range → Keep & Track as "rescued" ✅
```

## 📊 Example Output

```bash
✅ DATE EXTRACTION COMPLETE: 45 with dates, 12 without
✅ LLM extracted date 2024-03-15 from content: New FDA approval for prostate cancer treatment...
✅ LLM rescued article with extracted date: Breaking: Clinical trial results show...
✅ DATE FILTERING COMPLETE: 40 in range, 8 rescued by LLM date extraction
```

## 💰 Cost Optimization

| Model | Use Case | Cost |
|-------|----------|------|
| `gpt-4o-mini` | Relevance analysis & curation | Standard |
| `gpt-3.5-turbo` | Date extraction only | ~10x cheaper |

**Result:** Smart date extraction without significantly increasing API costs.

## 🔍 Regex Patterns Added

1. **URL Date Patterns:**
   - `/2024/03/15/` → Extracts `2024-03-15`
   - `/20240315/` → Extracts `2024-03-15`

2. **Enhanced Search:**
   - Now checks URL + title + content (2000 chars total)
   - URL checked first (dates often in path)

## ✨ Benefits

1. **More Results:** Articles without metadata dates are not lost
2. **Cost Efficient:** Uses cheaper model for date extraction task
3. **Comprehensive:** Checks URL, content, metadata for dates
4. **Transparent:** Tracks and reports "LLM rescued" articles
5. **Quality:** Only includes articles with dates in range

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the enhancement works:

1. Run a search with articles that have dates in URLs
2. Check console for "LLM rescued" messages
3. Look for the rescued count in final stats
4. Verify extracted dates are within your search range
